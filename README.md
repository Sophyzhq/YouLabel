Colored rectangles in the image indicate the workflow
* Select dataset that should be worked on. After selection the file is loaded and the images of the dataset are displayed.
* Images of the loaded dataset are displayed. In RT-FDC datasets, the midpoint of each tracked object is stored. Based on this midpoint, the full image (left) is cropped (right) to show the tracked object in the center. To display the next or the previous image, the right and left arrow key can be used.    
* Buttons to indicate if the displayed image corresponds to class 1 (True) or class 2 (False). Alternatively, the keyboard shortcuts “T” and “F” may be used.   
* List shows the labelling decisions. By default, all events are labelled “True”.
